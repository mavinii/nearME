## 📝 Introduction:
**NearMe!** is a React Native application designed to help you discover the best discounts and promotions at your favorite nearby places. Save money with just a few taps.

### How it works:
1. **Find a Place**: Explore nearby locations offering great deals.
2. **Activate Your QR Code**: Scan the restaurant's QR code to unlock exclusive discounts.
3. **Enjoy Your Savings**: Redeem the best deals and make the most of your visit.

It’s as simple as that!

## 🚀 How to run this project:
1. **Start the server**: Open a terminal, navigate to the `api` folder, and run:
```bash
npm start
```
2. **Launch Prisma Studio**: In another terminal, navigate to the `api` folder, and run:
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
Access the Prisma database interface in your browser at: `http://localhost:5555`

3. **Start the mobile app**: Open another terminal, navigate to the `mobile` folder, and run:
```bash
npx expo start
```
Note the IP address generated by Expo (e.g., `Metro waiting on exp://192.168.x.x:3333`), and update the `baseURL` in `mobile/src/services/api.ts` to match your setup:
```bash
import axios from 'axios';

export const api = axios.create({
    baseURL: 'http://192.168.x.x:3333', // Replace with your IP address
    timeout: 700,
});
```

4. **Access the database**: Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5555`
